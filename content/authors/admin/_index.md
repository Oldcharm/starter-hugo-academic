Hi! I am a senior in physics at UIUC. I am graduating in the spring, and **I will apply for Ph.D. this fall.**

My research focuses on theoretical biophysics and ecology. I am particularly interested in using simple models to explain quantitative laws found at the cellular level, such as cell size control and cell cycle-dependent transcription. I am also interested in modeling and analyzing complex ecology communities. My interests in ecology include phylogenetic biodiversity and life-history strategies of microbiomes.

Currently, I work in [Ido Golding's Lab](https://bacteriophysics.web.illinois.edu/) and [James O'Dwyer's Lab](http://publish.illinois.edu/odwyerlab/) at UIUC for my undergraduate research. Previously, I visited Peking University. At PKU, I investigated the effect of single-cell variability in growth traits on population dynamics with [Jie Lin](http://cqb.pku.edu.cn/jlingroup/htmls/Members/Member_Linjie.html).
